      <h3>Introduction&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;Summer time is supposed to be fun and time to rejuvenate before stepping back into education. But sometimes summer doesn’t go as planned and we end up discovering things about ourselves. For me I discovered that my mental health, even with meds and friends around, wasn’t where it needed to be.</p>
      <h3>Illinois&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;My summer started relatively normal with me working my butt off at Walmart to earn money for the Texas trip at the end of summer break. I was working an 8 hour shift, 4 to 5 days a week, but I was still able to balance my time between work and spending time with friends. The friends I planned to go to Texas with were Emma and Kelli, people I became pretty close with over my Senior year in high school. Thanks to all the plans taking up my time my mental health wasn’t really a worry, I was just livin life.</p>
<h3>Mansfield, texas&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;At the beginning of our 13 hour road trip I felt sleepy and awkward, but I got used to the atmosphere and jammed out to music that they loved. We soon made it to the big beautiful house we would be staying at and I felt a sense of loneliness begin to creep up. But I shook it off and joined my friends in getting some groceries then heading to the backyard to swim in the nice freaking pool that Emma’s Aunt and Uncle owned. It was dark out but we kept on swimming, the girls went in and got showers as I layed on the ground and began to overthink past events. I had a few restless nights like that where I stayed up crying wondering why I was even in Texas because Emma and Kelli didn’t even really like me.</p>
<h3>Magnolia silos&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;One place we went was known as The Magnolia Silos and it was breathtaking, it was so lively and fun. We bounced around to the different shops, trying things on and taste testing whatever was given. That day we all dressed up and I once again became anxious about how I looked and wondered why I couldn’t even compare to my friends. I kept trying to shake those feelings, but when we tried stuff on it got worse since nothing I liked fit. I still enjoyed the day even with all the emotions I was feeling. But I will never forget that feeling because I hated it so much, I felt like I was another person in someone else’s skin.</p>
