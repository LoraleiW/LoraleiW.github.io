      <h3>favorite brand&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;My favorite brand right now would have to be Cloak. Two of my favorite youtubers or childhood youtubers, Markiplier and Jacksepticeye, created this company/website together. Along with creating the brand, they also model the products themselves along with other youtubers like CrankGameplays and Pokimane. Their site/brand continues to change as their current style revolves around the new game, Dead Space, where they ended up getting a collab deal. But before their products were under the concept called Tactical: Frost. I love the design of their website and how different it is nearly every time I decide to take a look at the new products.</p>
<h3>Why cloak?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Two of my favorite youtubers run the website for one, and two their products are always so cool and get great reviews. Besides that the website looks so aesthetically pleasing, even when they change fonts and/or concepts for upcoming products. The current design is dark and space themed as the collab they are currently promoting is the game Dead Space.The dark colors and the suttle spaceship in the background that sit behind the products is just so freaking cool to me, and the products are Dead Space themed so they also help to tie everything together.The setup for the website is also very aesthetic as it shows products then goes to the specific categories for said products.&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>what do i plan to use?&nbsp;</h3>
<p>&nbsp;I plan to find something to keep as the main background for my website, but as I scroll it will stay there. The font for the brand name is also cool, so I might use it for the titles of anything I write, or as just the main font for anything I write. I plan to use the said background of my choice to then use colors from it to make the website I design seamless and pleasing to the eye. Cloak has been known to use somewhat darker colors, which are quite nice on the eyes, I mean it's like dark mode on a laptop.</p>
      <h3>my logo header&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;For my logo header, I plan to make it kind of memorable/funny by using my gamer tag, LarryTheLob. So for the logo I might try and find a clipart of a lobster or crab claw and then use any font I think fits as my logo. I hope to use underwater colors, like some dark blues and greens, and then a few pops of other colors that come from fish. I'd love to make it a coral theme or even a fish tank kind of vibe.</p>
