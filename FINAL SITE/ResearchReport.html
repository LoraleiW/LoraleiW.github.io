<h3>Is it deja vu or a disorder?&nbsp;</h3>
<p> As you sit in class you feel a weird chill up your spine and to the back of your neck. You immediately look up and as you do, everything seems brighter, colors more vibrant, and it feels like you're looking through a window inside your head. Or as a better example, it's like putting on a VR headset, maybe even the effects of getting high. These symptoms or feelings can be branches of many different disorders, diseases, and sicknesses. DPDR (Depersonalization-derealization) disorder is a very psyche-based disorder that is said to be affected or more active due to panic and anxiety. So people with PTSD are at the high part of the demographic when it comes to not just this disorder but any that involves dissociation <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0145445512461651">[1]</a>. Being detached from your body and seeing your surroundings as unreal can be very scary. But when deja vu happens, we freak for a second then carry on. DPDR plays on our psyche to make scenes or places we see as familiar, not so familiar, maybe even uncomfortable in a place we are meant to be comfortable. An example is relaxing in your bed when the feeling just happens and when you look around you feel like nothing is real, you are in a dream and if you close your eyes you’ll wake back up and everything will go back to normal. It’s common for people with depersonalization/derealization disorder to fear that they don’t really exist, or that their symptoms are the result of irreversible brain damage <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/depersonalizationderealization-disorder">[3]</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Feeling emotionally numb&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Can’t control words or actions&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Detached from ordinary sensations (touch, sight, taste)&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Objects are the wrong size or color&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Time feels like it's speeding up or slowing down&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span style="color: #000000">Sounds are louder or softer</span> <span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;</span></li>
      </ul>
<h3>Why me?&nbsp;</h3>
<p> &nbsp;Some main causes behind why we may experience DPDR are panic disorders and social anxiety disorders, which may also occur as side effects of recreational drugs such as cannabis <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/depersonalizationderealization-disorder">[3]</a>. Stress is a really big one because we are all stressed at some point in our lives, and sometimes when it becomes a bit too much we tend to experience different things happening to our bodies to kind of warn us that we might be stressing ourselves out a little too much. Studies indicate that .8 to 2.8 percent of the population in the United States and elsewhere has had the disorder at some point in the course of their life <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/depersonalizationderealization-disorder">[3]</a>. Another main cause for a more recent increase in cases is the hype around virtual reality. Virtual reality is a big thing within the gaming community and just anyone really because experiencing something like fighting a dragon in your living room is just really appealing to some people. But sometimes people have issues with how the system works since it revolves around the usage of lenses and headgear that trick your brain and senses into thinking you are somewhere else. This trickery can make people really sick, more specifically motion sickness. But the effects of using virtual reality for extended amounts of time cause some people to sort of lose themself when they take the headset off. They forget that they are no longer in the virtual world, and so their eyes and brain continue the whole virtual reality vision specifically. One VR consumer, for instance, reports that after VR gaming, he first perceived his hands to be unreal, and then, he felt completely alienated from his own body and to be detached from reality [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222000553">2</a>].</p>
<h3>Why worry?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p> &nbsp;DPDR is just one of the many disorders, disabilities, and diseases that need to be talked about more and just made aware of. This awareness can help someone to realize that they aren’t crazy or that maybe they can get help because there is something wrong. The number of medical issues that people have that some have never heard of is massive. These gaps in knowledge can really hurt a generation of people, especially when a big reason as to why some people experience it is cannabis, anxiety, and stress, three huge factors that go into the backgrounds or personalities of younger generations. As older generations die off, the younger ones just keep getting more and more anxious and stressed due to all the workload that is left over from the older generations Dissociation can come in many forms and being aware of the many forms can really help people. The helping starts by first just recognizing that someone is experiencing an episode of dissociation and that they could be scared. Sometimes being able to know what others see of you when it happens can sometimes help to better understand the situation you might be in. Many disorders can go hand in hand when it comes to all the symptoms that can easily overlap, for example, ADHD and autism is sometimes confused since loud kids who play rough can be easily written off as ADHD. Compared to a kid who has issues learning so they label him autistic when the roles are switched, the loud kid who plays rough is the autistic one and the one who is having a hard time has ADHD. But that doesn’t mean that a child with ADHD will always have issues with school or focusing, instead they are loud. The point is when it comes to the brain and the psychosis of it all, a majority of the time disorders branch from one another as a way to possibly cope or fix what the brain is going through.</p>
